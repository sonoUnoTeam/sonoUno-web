<h1 id="1">1. Software description</h1>
<p>
  SonoUno is a sonification software for astronomical data presented on a
  table (txt or csv files). The software is being developed based on the
  study of other software (Sonification Sandbox, MathTrax and xSonify) and
  standards of accessibility like the ISO 9241-171:2008 (Guidance on
  software accessibility) and the Web Accessibility Initiative &ndash;
  Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) guidelines. In order to
  develop the first approach of a graphical user interface, we perform a
  theoretical framework based on bibliography of user cases, focused on
  blind and visually impa people.
</p>
<p>
  The development framework is Angular which promotes modularity, in
        order to do collaborative work. Being this version of SonoUno web based,
        is accessible from nearly any platform; the development team worked with
        this aim in mind. The main goal of SonoUno is to allow the user to open
        data files (txt or csv extension), show the plot and sonify the data. At
        the moment, the sonification is performed by variation of pitch and the sonification settings allow to change the volume and the timbre.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, SonoUno allows users to select a specific range of data
        on the &lsquo;x&rsquo; axis, mark and save points of interest in the
        data, apply predefined mathematical functions (for example, logarithm
        and square) and manipulate the data arrays with an Octave interface. In
        the settings section, the user can configure the plot and some features
        of the sound.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the software allows the user to save the plot, a text file
        with the points marked on the data and a csv file with the plotted
        data.
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="2">2. Opening the software</h1>
<p>
  Being a web based
        application accessing to sonoUno it&rsquo;s as easy as to type the url
        on your preferred browser:
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" href='http://190.15.198.99:8083/'
  >http://190.15.198.99:8083/</a
>
<p>This link opens the landing page for the web version of sonoUno</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;Angular&rsquo;s support extends to the latest Edge, Firefox, Chrome and
  Safari versions, so it&rsquo;s advised to update your browser. (Image 1). If
  after entering the url you don&rsquo;t get the sonoUno&rsquo;s homepage first
  check:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check that you have typed the correct url.</li>
  <li>Check your network connection and access to the internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If after that you still can&rsquo;t establish a connection send a message to
  the development team via e-mail:
</p>
<p>sonounoteam@gmail.com</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen1.png" alt="image" /></div>
  <p class="epigrafe">Image 1. The image shows Firefox browser and the web page of sonoUno</p>

<p>At the landing page it is possible to select between HOME and QUICK
  START and also decide if not to show this page again.</p>

  <h1 id="2.1">2.1. QUICK START Guide</h1>
  <p>The recommendation is for the new users  to go first to the QUICK START (Figure 2), where a short explanation of each section of the web interface (on the screen) and functionalities setting by default are detailed.</p>

  <div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen2.png" alt="image" /></div>
  <p class="epigrafe">Image 2. The image shows Firefox browser and the Quickstart Guide of sonoUno</p>


  <h1 id="2.2">2.2. Home page</h1>

<p>The home page of sonoUno greets you with four distinct sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The navigation bar with the access to the File functionalities; Input/Output functions, Sample data and the access to the Help and the Quickstart guides. This design was based on a user case study (Image 3)

  </li>
  <li>
    The graph has four buttons to control “Play/Pause”, “Stop”, “Mark Point” and “Delete Mark” and two sliders to control the abscissa position and the tempo (Image 4).

  </li>
  <li>
    Below the sliders, a MathFunctions bar permits selecting between simple mathematical functions to apply to the data (Image 4)
  </li>
  <li>
    The sound configuration section has the tools to modify the way audio is processed, if you press on this button you will see all the Sound configuration options (Image 5). 
  </li>
  <li>The plot configuration section allows you to modify the way the data is displayed in the graph, if you press on this button you will see all the Plot configuration options (Image 6).   </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Every section will be explained in detail in further chapters of this help
  guide.

  <h1 id="2.3">2.3. Testing sonoUno web</h1>  
<p>
  You can start testing the SonoUno functionalities with the sample data that's provided under the dropdown menu “Sample Data”.  Just select any of the options under this menu to get the data (Image 7) automatically loaded on your graph area  and the audio be ready to play.
</p>
<p>In order to listen to the graph just press the button “Play” under the graph. You should see an orange bar moving from left to right indicating the progress on the data being played and hear the pitch variations matching the data.</p>

<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen7.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 7. sonoUnoweb  Sample Data Menu</p>
<p>
  If you can see the black bar moving but still no sound comes out from your
  headphones or speakers:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check your speakers or headphones connection to your PC.</li>
  <li>Check your sound configuration: volume level and mute.</li>
  <li>
    Check if your browser has blocked the sound reproduction and that the tab is
    not muted.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the problems continue or you have another problem, please inform this
  to the developer team.

<h1 id="2.4">2.4. Things to keep in mind</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Some widgets, like warnings or confirmation buttons may be in your browser configured language. Otherwise, the software language is always English. In the future the team is looking forward to unifying the languages. 
  </li>
  <li>
    In the files to import the first column must have continuous values, it is used as a coordinate dependent axis. 

  </li>
  <li>
    All screenshots and images shown are for illustration purposes only, the real image can change a little depending on the web browser.

  </li>
</ul>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>

<h1 id="3.0">3.0. Opening a file</h1>
<p>
  To open a .csv or .txt file, you can use the option “Browse.” under the File dropdown menu (Image 8). This action will open a pop-up window with your operating system’s file explorer (Image 9), where you can search and open any data file.
</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen8.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 8 Shows the items on the menu File and the focus of the keyboard is on the Open item.</p>

<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen9.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 9 Pop-up window of the File explorer, shown after selecting the item.</p>

<p>
  When you have the data file selected, press the button Open or the Enter key. The sonoUno will generate the graph (Image 10) and update the abscissa’s slide bar. Everything is ready, pressing the “Play” button should start the reproduction.

</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen10.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 10. The sonoUno framework with the graph of the imported data, in this case a GW glitch.</p>

<p>
  The shortcut for opening a file is Shift+O. After pressing the shortcut the process is identical to selecting the option in the navigation bar.
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="3.1">3.1. Mark and Delete all marks button</h1>
<p>
  Before starting with this functionality, we must explain that the sonoUno allows the user to mark points of interest on the data, and store the coordinates on a vector or file. These marks are shown with a diverse amount of user selectable symbols over the plot (Image 11). 
</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen11.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 11 Displays the sonoUno interface with an opened data file, in the plot there is one vertical black line (position of the playing coordinate) and several blue circles  marking points of interest on the graph.</p>

<p>
  The functionality of the “Delete Mark” button placed under the graph (Image11), is to erase the last added mark point on the data.  
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="4">4. Save files</h1>
<p>
  There are two ways to save files
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the  dropdown menu, the option “Output” deploys the list of options to save:  Sound, Marked Points, Plot (from top to bottom)  (Image 12).
    <div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen12.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 12 Displays the sonoUno interface with an opened data file. At the top Menu, the Output button displays the Save Sound, Save Markers , Save Plot possibilities.
</p>

  </li>
 
  <li>
    The other is the shortcut Shift+W.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods have the same results.</p>

<p>
  A way the user can store the sound from the data provided to sonoUno is the “Save Sound” feature  (Image 13).  T In order to save the sound, the user has to press the save sound item on the File menu
</p>
<p>
  The software will process the sound corresponding to the actual data displayed in the plot but with some standard sound configuration and then store it in your computer on a .wav file  (image 14). 
</p>
<p>The process to save the sound depends on the data file and can take some minutes.</p>

<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen13.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 13 Shows the file menu opened in the navigation bar and the Save Sound option selected</p>

<p class="epigrafe">Image 14  Shows the pop up panel that opens after pressing save sound for a Mac. If no pop-up is opened, you may have checked the auto download option on your browser and your file should be in your Downloads folder.</p>

<p>Before continuing with the save methods, remember that the software allows to do marks of interest on the data (Image 15), saving the coordinates inside an array, this topic is explained in the corresponding section. We mention it here because in the next lines the save marks method is described.
</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen15.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 15 Shows the Save Markers option focused on the file menu.</p>

<p>
  In order to save the values of the marks performed on the data array the user has to press the save markers item, placed on the File menu (Image 15).
</p>
<p>
  The save marks option shows a pop-up window of the file system (Image 16) that allows the user to select the directory and the name of the text file. After saving them, the marks are deleted from the sonoUno and the plot (Image 17). 
</p>
<p>
  The save markers option shows a similar pop-up window to the “save sound” feature, and then downloads the .csv file. The format of the name is the plot’s title plus “ markers.csv”. 
</p>
<p>
  It's important to remember that the array of markers should have at least one marker in order for this to work properly.

<h1 id="5">5. Exit the sonoUno</h1>
<div class="border"><img  class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen20c.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>
  Being web based, exiting sonoUno is as simple as closing your current tab hitting the “X” at the end of the tabs title. The default shortcut for most browsers is Ctrl+W or Cmd+W depending on your operating system, this may vary.
</p>
<p>
  Important: Be sure to store every piece of data you want to save before closing the tab to avoid data loss. 
</p>
<p>
  You can also quit sonoUno by closing your browser, just keep in mind that you are going to close every other tab opened at the time.

<h1 id="6">6. Functionalities</h1>
<h1 id="6.1">6.1. Abscissas position</h1>
<p>
  The slider of abscissa position allows the user to shift the point of data being played (Image 21). The slider shows the posicion (with a number) and also is possible to move it wuth the keyboard arrows if the mouse is on  this button .
</p>
<div class="border"><img  class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen21.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>
  Image 21 Shows the slider, while being selected is possible to move it left and right with your keyboard arrows 
</p>
<div class="border"><img  class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen22.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>
  Image 22 As you can see the percentage of the “Abscissa Position Slider” corresponds to the position of the black line on the plot.
</p>


<p>
  The abscissa position can be modified before, during and after the reproduction of the data. If the reproduction is in progress, after change the reproduction continues from the new set value. 
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="6.2">6.2. Tempo selection</h1>
<p>
  This slider controls the duration of each tone. The range goes from 0% to 100%, being 100 the shortest and 0 the longest time.
</p>
<p>
  It’s placed under the plot and to the right of the abscissa slider (Image 23). The operation is analogous to the abscissa position slider.  
</p>
<div class="border"><img class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen23.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>
  Image 23  The tempo slider is on the bottom right of the image.
</p>

<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="6.3">6.3. Play and Pause button</h1>
<p>
  It’s the first button under the graph (Image 24). When pressed, it changes its name to “Pause” and starts the reproduction of the data, the vertical black line and the abscissa position slider start to go forward, indicating the coordinates of the data being played. 
</p>
<div class="border"><img class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen24.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>
  Image 24  The play button is found on the bottom left of the image, under the graph, being the first button
</p>

<p>
  Another way to start the reproduction is with the shortcut key ”Shift+P”. This way of interacting differs from the previous two, because when pressed produces the effect directly, without modifying the keyboard focus. 
</p>
<p>
  To pause the reproduction of the data you have to press the same button or the same shortcut key, this action maintains the vertical red line position to be able to resume it later with the play button. 
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="6.4">6.4. Stop button</h1>
<p>
  Its function is to stop the reproduction and restart the process, which means that it sets the abscissa position to zero and deletes the vertical red line from the plot (Image 25). Another way to stop the reproduction is with the shortcut key ‘Shift+S’. 

</p>

<div class="border"><img class="achicar" src="/assets/help/imagen25.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p>

<h1 id="6.5">6.5. Mark point button</h1>
<p>
  This button allows the user to mark a specific point from the data. When the button is pressed sonoUno saves the current position on a vector and displays it on the graph with a symbol. (Image 26) 
</p>
<img class='achicar' src="/assets/help/image26.png" alt="image" />
<p>
  Image 26  The mark point button is found under the graph, next to the stop button.
</p>
<p>
  In parallel, the user can mark a point on the graph with the shortcut key ‘Shift+M’. The shortcut has the same effect as pressing the button but without modifying the keyboard focus. 
</p>
<a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
<h1 id="6.6">6.6. Delete last mark button</h1>
<p>
  This functionality allows the user to erase the last mark made with the mark point element. It’s useful when the user has made a mark without intention or the place is incorrect. The button is placed beneath the graph, it’s the fourth button, next to the mark point button (Image 27). 
</p>
<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen27.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 27  The delete last mark button is found on the bottom right of the graph section. It’s the fourth button from left to right.</p>

<p>
  A checkbox allows for the selection of frequency mapping and the two sliders beneath it modify the minimum and maximum frequency used in the variable mapping. 
</p>
<p>
  The next combo box, with a list, allows the user to choose between some sound types to use. These sounds are not intended to sound like real instruments, but rather just loosely recall those instrument’s sounds in order to present the user with some distinguishable options.
</p>

<div class="border"><img class='achicar' src="/assets/images/imagen31.png" alt="image" /></div>
<p class="epigrafe">Image 31  Advanced Sound Configuration</p>
<p>The Advanced Sound Configurations includes the configuration of envelope filters (Image 31). A checkbox is used to enable and disable the filter. After checking it you can use the attack, decay, sustain and release sliders to modify the resulting sound. </p>
<p>NOTE: All the sliders inside the mapping configuration must be enabled and disabled with check boxes, this is to ensure a better navigation with the screen reader and a lower memory overload. </p>
