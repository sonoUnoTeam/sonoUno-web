    <h1 id="1.0">1. Software description</h1>
    <p>
      SonoUno is a sonification software for astronomical data presented on a table
      (txt or csv files). The software is being developed based on the study of
      other software (Sonification Sandbox, MathTrax and xSonify) and standards of
      accessibility like the ISO 9241-171:2008 (Guidance on software accessibility)
      and the Web Accessibility Initiative &ndash; Accessible Rich Internet
      Applications (WAI-ARIA) guidelines. In order to develop the first approach of
      a graphical user interface, we perform a theoretical framework based on
      bibliography of user cases, focused on blind and visual impa people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development framework is Angular which promotes modularity, in order to do
      collaborative work. Being this version of SonoUno web based, is accessible
      from nearly any platform; the development team worked with this aim in mind.
      The main goal of SonoUno is to allow the user to open data files (txt or csv
      extension), show the plot and sonify the data. At the moment, the sonification
      is performed by variation of pitch and the sonification settings allow to
      change the volume and the timbre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, SonoUno allows users to select a specific range of data on the
      &lsquo;x&rsquo; axis, mark and save points of interest in the data, apply
      predefined mathematical functions (for example, logarithm and square) and
      manipulate the data arrays with an Octave interface. In the settings section,
      the user can configure the plot and some features of the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the software allows the user to save the plot, a text file with the
      points marked on the data and a csv file with the plotted data.
    </p>
    <a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
    <h1 id="2.0">2. Opening the software</h1>
    <p>
      Being a web based application accessing to sonoUno it&rsquo;s as easy as to
      type the url on your preferred browser:
    </p>
    <p>http://190.15.198.99:8083/</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Angular&rsquo;s support extends to the latest Edge, Firefox, Chrome and
      Safari versions, so it&rsquo;s advised to update your browser. (Image 1). If
      after entering the url you don&rsquo;t get the sonoUno&rsquo;s homepage first
      check:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check that you have typed the correct url.</li>
      <li>Check your network connection and access to the internet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If after that you still can&rsquo;t establish a connection send a message to
      the development team via e-mail:
    </p>
    <p>sonounoteam@gmail.com</p>
    <img src="/assets/help/image1.png" alt="image">
    <p>Image 1. The image shows Firefox browser and the web page of sonoUno</p>
    <p>The home page of sonoUno greets you with four distinct sections:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The navigation bar with the access to the File and Sample Data
        functionalities and a button that takes you to the help guide. This design
        was based on a user cases study.
      </li>
      <li>
        The graph with four buttons to control &ldquo;Play/Pause&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mark Point&rdquo; and &ldquo;delete
        markpoint&rdquo; and two sliders to control the abscissa position and the
        tempo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sound configuration section has the tools to modify the way audio is
        processed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The plot configuration section allows you to modify the way the data is
        displayed in the graph.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Every section will be explained in detail in further chapters of this help
      guide.

    <p>
      You can start testing the SonoUno functionalities with the sample data that's
      provided under the dropdown menu &ldquo;Sample Data&rdquo;. Just select any of
      the options under this menu to get the data automatically loaded on your graph
      and the audio be ready to play
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to listen to the graph just press the button &ldquo;Play&rdquo; under
      the graph. You should see an orange bar moving from left to right indicating
      the progress on the data being played and hear the pitch variations matching
      the data.

    <p>
      If you can see the black bar moving but still no sound comes out from your
      headphones or speakers:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check your speakers or headphones connection to your PC.</li>
      <li>Check your sound configuration: volume level and mute.</li>
      <li>
        Check if your browser has blocked the sound reproduction and that the tab is
        not muted.

    <p>
      To open a .csv or .txt file, you can use the option &ldquo;Browse..&rdquo;
      under the File dropdown menu. This action will open a pop-up window with your
      operating system&rsquo;s file explorer(Image 7), where you can search and open
      the data file.
    </p>
    <img class="achicar" src="/assets/help/image4.png" alt="image">

      The sonoUno will generate the graph(Image 8) and update the abscissa&rsquo;s
      slide bar. Everything is ready, pressing the &ldquo;Play&rdquo; button should
      start the reproduction.

    <h1  id="4.1.2">4.1.2 Delete all marks button</h1>
    <p>
      Before starting with this functionality, we must explain that the sonoUno
      allows the user to mark points of interest on the data, and store the
      coordinates on a vector or file. These marks are shown with a diverse amount
      of user selectable symbols over the plot.(Image 11).
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/help/image7.png" alt="image">
    <p>
      Image 11 &ndash; Display the sonoUno interface with an opened data file, in
      the plot there is one vertical black line (position of the playing coordinate)
      and several blue diamonds marking points of interest on the graph.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The functionality of the Delete button placed under the graph(Image 11), is to
      erase the last added mark point on the data.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <a class="nav-link active mr-5" (click)="anchorNav('indice')">Back to index</a>
    <h1 id="4.1.3">4.1.3 Save files</h1>
    <p>
      There are two ways to save files: one is in the file dropdown menu, the save
      sound option; and the other is the shortcut Shift+W. Both methods have the
      same results.
    </p>
    <p>
      A way the user can store the sound from the data provided to sonoUno is the
      &ldquo;Save Sound&rdquo; feature. The software will process the sound
      corresponding to the actual data displayed in the plot but with some standard
      sound configuration and then store it in your computer on a .wav file. In
      order to save the sound, the user has to press the save sound item on the File
      menu.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/help/image8.png" alt="image">
    <p>
      Image 14 &ndash; Shows the file menu opened in the navigation bar and the save

      Image 15. Shows the pop up panel that opens after pressing save sound. If no
      pop-up is opened, you may have checked the auto download option on your
      browser and your file should be in your Downloads folder
    </p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>
      Before continuing with the save methods, remember that the software allows to
      do marks of interest on the data, saving the coordinates inside an array, this
      topic is explained in the corresponding section. We mention it here because in
      the next lines the save marks method is described.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/help/image10.png" alt="image">
    <p>Image 17 &ndash; Shows the Save Markers option focused on the file menu.</p>
    <p>
      In order to save the values of the marks performed on the data array the user
      have to press the save marks item, placed on the File menu.(Image 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The save marks option shows a pop-up window of the file system (Image 18) that
      allows the user to select the directory and the name of the text file. After
      saving them, the marks are deleted from the sonoUno and the plot (Image 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The save markers option shows a similar pop-up window to the &ldquo;save
      sound&rdquo; feature, and then downloads the .csv file. The format of the name
      is the plot&rsquo;s title plus &ldquo; markers.csv&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to remember that the array of markers should have at least one
      marker in order for this to work properly.

    </p>
    <img src="/assets/help/image14.png" alt="image">
    <p>
      The resulting files in your downloads folders should look something like this.
      The original .csv file with the provided data, a .csv file with the markers
      and a .wav file with the sound.

      Image 21- A slider allows to modify the volume of the sound and two buttons,
      the first one sets a logarithmic scale for the data processing and a second
      button can be used to load some sound preset configuration better suited for
      playing continuous sounds or discrete sound steps.

      A checkbox allows for the selection of frequency mapping and the two sliders
      beneath it modify the minimum and maximum frequency used in the variable
      mapping.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The next combo box, with a list, allows the user to choose between some sound
      types to use. These sounds are not intended to sound like real instruments,
      but rather just loosely recall those instrument&rsquo;s sounds in order to
      present the user with some distinguishable options.
    </p>

      The last part has the configuration of  envelope filter. A checkbox is used
      to enable and disable the filter. After checking it you can use the attack,
      decay, sustain and release sliders to modify the resulting sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: All the sliders inside the mapping configuration must be enabled and
      disabled with check boxes, this is to ensure a better navigation with the
      screen reader and a lower memory overload.
